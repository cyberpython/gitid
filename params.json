  "body": "# gitid\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nA utility program that extracts the latest git tag name for the current HEAD and\r\nits SHA-1 commit id and then recursively replaces all occurences of CVS-like \r\nmarkers in all source code files.\r\n\r\n**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**\r\n\r\nThe following markers are supported (case sensitive):\r\n\r\n- `Id`\r\n- `Name`\r\n\r\n`$Id$` is replaced by `$Id: <SHA-1 commit id> $` and `$Name$` is replaced by \r\n`$Name: <git tag name> $`. If no tag is found, then `$Name$` is replaced by \r\n`$Name: WORKING $`.\r\n\r\nThe file name extensions that are used are loaded from a file named `extensions.txt`\r\nplaced in the same directory with the gitid executable.\r\n\r\nIf the `extensions.txt` file is not found, only files with the following extensions \r\nare elligible for keyword substitution:\r\n\r\n        .adb, .ads, .c, .h, .cpp, .hpp, .cc, .java, .py, .js, .cs, .rc, .xml, .html, .htm, .xhtml\r\n\r\n## Build instructions\r\n\r\nThe program has been built and tested under:\r\n- Linux Mint 17.3 32bit using GCC 4.8.4 and libgit2 0.22.0.\r\n- MS Windows using MinGW32 (gcc 4.8.1) and libgit2 0.22.0 (built with VS 2010 Express).\r\n\r\nIn order to build the program:\r\n\r\n- Download and build [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) (on Windows, on Linux you can use your package manager to install the library and headers).\r\n- Compile with:\r\n        gcc -o gitid.exe src\\gitid.c src\\git_helper.c -I<libgit2_include_dir_path> -L<libgit2_lib_dir_path> -lgit2\r\n\r\nFor example on Windows:\r\n\r\n        gcc -o gitid.exe src\\gitid.c src\\git_helper.c -IC:\\projects\\libgit2-0.22.0\\include -LC:\\projects\\libgit2-0.22.0\\build\\Debug -lgit2\r\n        \r\nAnd on Linux:\r\n\r\n        gcc -o gitid src/gitid.c src/git_helper.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lgit2\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nPut it on your system PATH and then call it in the directory where your source code resides.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nEach file is read in memory and then written back to disk for each keyword that is searched (currently 2 - Name and Id).\r\nThis means that\r\n- **If something goes wrong it might mess up your source files!!!** \r\n- It could be very slow and memory intensive if you have many large files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Georgios Migdos\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
